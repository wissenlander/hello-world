Hello world!

I'm Tim, and I'm fairly new to this programming lark. Currently trying to get myself up to speed on a variety of subjects, Git included, with the intent to transitioning over into full stack development. 

I was once a simple chemist, lured away by the bright, dazzling lights of LCD monitors and blinking terminal cursors.

Currently working on:

Learning a range of programming languages (albeit at different rates) C/C++, C# and the .Net framework, JavaScript and I have a feeling a bit of Scheme is on the horizon as anything wrapped in purple is too much of a distraction to ignore.

Current books:
- C# 6.0 in a Nutshell
- Eloquent JavaScript
- K&R C
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- Soft Skills - The software developer's life manual

I hope I have the fortitude and perseverance to push through to the end of this leg of my journey.
